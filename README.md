### Hi there, I'm Daniel!

I am and have been an avid open source supporter and developer since the mid 1990s. You find most of my
contributions in the [curl project](https://github.com/curl/curl) and other network related projects.

File issues and pull-requests in any and all of the projects I participate in. Contact me via
email at `daniel@haxx.se` on twitter at [@bagder](https://twitter.com/bagder/) or on IRC in the
`#curl` channel on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/).

Everything about me and my projects are also available on [my website](https://daniel.haxx.se).
